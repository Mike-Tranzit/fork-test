# Pull request checklist and workflow
These criteria are for contributors to documentation on [docs.microsoft.com](http://docs.microsoft.com). These validation criteria will be applied to **all** pull requests coming from non-CX contributors and are assessed by the PR Review Team (PRRT).

## Affected repos
Currently, only pull requests from non-CX contributors to the following repos are reviewed by the PR Review team:
* UWP conceptual ([windows-uwp](https://cpubwin.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/windows-uwp/_git/windows-uwp))
* WinRT API ([winrt-api](https://cpubwin.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/windows-uwp/_git/winrt-api))
* WinRT API-related ([winrt-related](https://cpubwin.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/windows-uwp/_git/winrt-related))

> [!NOTE]
> PRs submitted through the public GitHub repos are also assessed using this checklist; see [GitHub workflow](#pull-request-workflow-github) below.

## Content quality criteria
The updates in the pull request must comply with the following criteria to be merged. In the case of any failure, the PR Review team will follow up with the opener and invite them to resubmit after addressing the violation(s).

## Pull request workflow (VSTS)
The PR Review team will review **all** pull requests coming from outside of WDG CX.

> [!NOTE]
> WDG CX writers are not required to go through the PR Review team, but they are expected to adhere to the content-health criteria above.
> The pull request quality criteria are not designed to take the place of an edit pass. Writers can continue to request editing at [aka.ms/edit-developer](http://aka.ms/edit-developer).

1. The pull request is initiated; the PR Review team reviews according to the criteria above. If necessary, PR Review works with the opener to make any necessary updates. (**Note:** The PR Review team currently seeks to do its initial assessment of each PR within *one business day* of opening; this may be adjusted based on volume.)
2. If the pull request is approved, the PR Review team determines if the change is sufficient to require CX owner review.
3. The PR Reviewer tags the CX owner(s) in the pull request and adds their approval in the description. If CX owner review is not needed, the editor merges the change.
4. The CX owner reviews the pull request and works directly with the opener as needed.
5. Once the CX owner has signed off, they approve and the pull request is merged automatically.

## Pull request workflow (GitHub)
The PR Review team will review all pull requests coming in through any public GitHub repos. Pull requests must adhere to the above criteria, but where possible the PR Review team will work with the CX owner to address the issues wherever possible.
