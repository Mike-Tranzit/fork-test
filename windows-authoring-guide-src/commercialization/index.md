# Contribute to Commercialization documentation

The Commercialization team manages its content primarily in a private repository that is hosted on VSO:

## Why two repositories?
We maintain a private repository for internal contributions. This repository is also needed to hold pre-release content. Once published, content is then mirrored in the public repository, where we also accept contributions from the public.

## Who can contribute?
The public repository is intended for contributions external to Microsoft.

Microsoft employees should contribute to our private repository using one of the two options below.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are contributing to pre-release content, you must contribute via the private repository.

## How do I contribute to the private repository?
You have two options:
- [Web Interface](contribute-via-web.md) (recommended for smaller edits, usually single-topic)
- [Local clone](contribute-via-local-clone.md) (recommended for larger edits to multiple topics)
