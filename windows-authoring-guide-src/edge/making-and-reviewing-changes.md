# Making and reviewing a change

This section requires knowledge of the Git version control system. If you are unfamiliar or just want a refresher, please complete the [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git/](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git/) tutorial. At a minimum, you need to understand pulling, pushing, branching, and merging.

## Configuring Git

If this is the first time you've installed Git on a new machine, you need to configure Git by giving it your name and email address. **This only needs to be done once**. You can read more details [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).

```cmdprompt
C:\gitrepos\edge-developer>git config --global user.name "Your Name"

C:\gitrepos\edge-developer>git config --global user.email youralias@microsoft.com
```

## Working in a personal branch

In the Git workflow, changes are made in a personal branch. This is done from the command line.

1. Use the `checkout` command to switch to one of the main branches. This will be the branch you merge your work back into after you're done. For info on which branch to use, see [branches](branches.md).

	```cmdprompt
	C:\gitrepos\edge-developer>git checkout vNext
	```
This main branch will be the parent of your personal branch, and it's the branch that will eventually receive your changes.
2. Sync to the latest version of the Git repository to your PC using `git pull -p`:

	```cmdprompt
	C:\gitrepos\edge-developer>git pull -p
	Already up-to-date.
	```
3. Create your branch:

	```cmdprompt
	C:\gitrepos\edge-developer>git checkout -b youralias-parentbranch/my-first-change
	Switched to the branch 'youralias-parentbranch/my-first-change
	```
The branch naming convention makes it easy to see who is working on what. Be descriptive. For example, `mattwojo-develop/bug-fixes-for-tile-how-to`.

## Editing a file

1. Use the checkout command to switch to your personal branch, if you haven't already.

	```cmdprompt
    C:\gitrepos\edge-developer>git checkout youralias-parentbranch/my-first-change
	Switched to the branch 'youralias-parentbranch/my-first-change
	```
2. Open the markdown file you want to edit. You can use any text editor.

Here's a sample file:
