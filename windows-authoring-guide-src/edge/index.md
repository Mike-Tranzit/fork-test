# Writing Microsoft Edge docs

Microsoft Edge Developer documentation source is located in the **Edge Developer repo**: [https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/edge-developer/](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/edge-developer/).

To view Microsoft Edge Developer documentation live, go to [https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/dev-guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/dev-guide).

The instructions in this section apply only to Edge Developer articles.

> [!NOTE]
> This repo is visible to the public--including markdown files, HTML comments, commit comments, and revision history.

## Who can contribute?
Anyone at Microsoft, or members of the public with a GitHub account, can contribute to the documentation.


## How do I contribute?
You can contribute through the [web interface](#use-the-web-interface), or by [setting up a local git repository](#set-up-a-local-git-repository).


### Use the web interface
- Go to the documentation page, for example: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/f12-devtools-guide/debugger](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/f12-devtools-guide/debugger)
Click the **Edit** button.
- The edit button takes you to the GitHub web interface for [that page in the Microsoft Edge repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/edge-developer/blob/develop/microsoft-edge/f12-devtools-guide/debugger.md)

You don't have to install anything to use the web interface. It's good for making small changes. If you go with this approach, you should still read the [Which branch do I use?](branches.md) article.

### Set up a local git repository
You can also use git locally and clone the repo. This approach requires around 15-20 minutes of setup time, but it's way more efficient if you plan on creating or editing lots of content. It also lets you preview content locally.

1. [Get set up](get-set-up.md)
