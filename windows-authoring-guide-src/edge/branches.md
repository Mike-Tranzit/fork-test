# Branching in the Edge-Developer repo

The [https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/edge-developer/](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/edge-developer/) has three main branches.

## Which main branch do I use?

+ **[develop](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/edge-developer)**: This branch is used for any updates to the documentation and can be viewed via the staging site at [https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/dev-guide?branch=develop](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/dev-guide?branch=develop).
+ **[live](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/edge-developer/tree/live)**: This branch is used only for content currently published on the live site. It is recommended that any changes be made in the "develop" branch.
+ **[vNext](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/edge-developer/tree/vNext)**: This branch is used for working on future releases that are not yet ready to be included in the live documentation and can be viewed via the staging site at [https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/dev-guide?branch=vNext](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/dev-guide?branch=vNext).

## Personal branches
Rather than working directly in an existing branch, you can also create a personal branch off one of the existing branches. Instructions for creating personal branches are covered in the next section, [Making and reviewing changes](making-and-reviewing-changes.md).
