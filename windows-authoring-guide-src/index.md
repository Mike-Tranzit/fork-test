## Authoring systems
We author most of content in the OP authoring system, which uses git-flavored markdown and GIT. If you are setting up git authoring for the first time, follow the instructions to [Set up a GitHub account](/windows-authoring-guide/github-account.md). 

Some of our older content sets, such as Win32 content, are in an older, xml-based system that doesn't allow for direct contributions. We're in the process of migrating many of these document sets to OP.
