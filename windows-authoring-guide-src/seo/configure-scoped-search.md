# Configure scoped search in Docs.microsoft.com

Planning to define the search scope for your content set, work with WDG CX SEO Lead [Tracey Nero](mailto:traceyw@microsoft.com) to understand the requirements for scoped search on Docs.mscom. Teams are enabled to set the search scope for each docset in a repo in the docfx.json file, add a new property to globalMetadata called searchScope.
