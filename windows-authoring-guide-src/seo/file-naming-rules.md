# File naming rules

When it comes to naming a file, it's important to make sure that the file naming convention clearly identifies topics in order to contribute towards discoverability on the web. All files must be in markdown and use the .md file extension.

## Enforced requirements

> Pull requests violating these rules will be rejected.

- Use hyphens to separate the words in the file name (not underscores).
- Use all lowercase letters (file names are case-sensitive).
- Do not use a trailing slash or special characters or spaces.

## Best practices
- Use action verbs that are specific such as *develop*, *buy*, *build*, and *troubleshoot* when possible.
- Use descriptive keywords that add context, relevance, and are human readable.
- Do not use more than 80 characters.

Examples of good file names:

- ```getting-started-choosing-a-programming-language.md```
- ```test-a-driver-package.md```

## Changing file names
Due to SEO implications, try to avoid changing file names after the content has been published to the live site. 

If such a change is unavoidable, use [OPS URL redirection](https://opsdocs.azurewebsites.net/en-us/opsdocs/partnerdocs/opredirection?branch=master) to avoid a 404.
