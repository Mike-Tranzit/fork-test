# SEO guidelines for WDG CX teams moving content to docs.microsoft.com

These SEO guidelines ensure that the current search presence for a topic is maintained (or improved) when migrating to docs.microsoft.com.

Migration of live web pages fall into three categories:

- [Optimize content for search with metadata](adding-metadata.md)
- [File naming and site architecture](file-naming-rules.md)
- [Scheduling redirects and maintaining search authority](https://opsdocs.azurewebsites.net/en-us/opsdocs/partnerdocs/opredirection?branch=master)


## Why Prioritize SEO tasks when you move content to a new site?

When you move content, change URLs, there is a high risk of negatively impacting discoverability and site traffic from external search engines. Over time, live site pages and websites acquire *search authority*, which is the algorithmic evaluation of topic (webpage) relevance and searcher engagement for results returned. The longer a page is live and has good click-through from the search engine result page, the greater the search authority and placement. When you publish a new URL, or move to a domain with less domain authority, you risk losing search authority.

It is essential during content migration to transfer the value acquired on old URLs to the new URLs. The following guidelines are intended to mitigate any loss or negative impact to the market share and discovery of your migrated content, along with minimizing loss in site visits and page views initiated from organic search.

For success during a migration of content to a new domain, coordinate with your SEO lead to review and optimize content in advance of going live.

## Track content performance pre and post migration

Work with your BI Analyst and SEO Lead to define KPIs (key performance indicators) important to your audience and business. 


**[WDG CX SEO Migration Dashboard (all properties)](https://msit.powerbi.com/groups/650cff89-645b-4dd4-98cb-b7d9b8fe3a55/dashboards/3095f059-bd49-4572-8573-10886d7257ae)**
Use this dashboard to identify issues with your migration and compare old content URLs to new content URLs (preferably prior to go live date). Consider the following site metrics:

- Search, referral, and direct traffic: Number of visits to the URL from either a search engine, a referral from another site, or directly entering the URL.

- Reach: To see URL impressions, clicks, and click thru rate (CTR) in organic search, see the Google Search Console (Link??)

- Search presence: This is based on target keywords and tracks page rankings in Google and Bing (for en-us market).
