## Contribute small changes with the web interface

You can make small edits and updates right in your web browser by going to the **VSGit Windows-UWP repo**: [https://cpubwin.visualstudio.com/_git/windows-uwp](https://cpubwin.visualstudio.com/_git/windows-uwp).
1. Open the markdown (.md) file you want to edit in the **windows-apps-src** folder
2. Select the branch to make your changes in -- **It is NOT recommended to make your changes in the Master branch**. You can select an existing branch from the "All branches" tab or create your own branch with the "+ New branch..." button. ([Which branch do I use?](branches.md))

3. Now that you have selected your branch, click the **"Edit"** button and make your changes. (For tips, see the Docs.MS OPS Guide: [Markdown syntax, OPS-supported Markdown extensions and HTML](https://opsdocs.azurewebsites.net/en-us/opsdocs/partnerdocs/gfm?branch=master).)

4. When your update is complete, write a commit message describing your changes at the top of the page, then click the "Commit" button (Save disc icon).

You don't have to install anything to use the web interface. It's good for making small changes.
