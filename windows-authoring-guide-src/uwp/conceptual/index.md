# Writing UWP conceptual ("how-to") docs

Windows UWP conceptual docs are located in the **windows-uwp repo**: [https://cpubwin.visualstudio.com/windows-uwp/_git/windows-uwp](https://cpubwin.visualstudio.com/windows-uwp/_git/windows-uwp).

## Where can I view content?
- [Windows UWP conceptual staging site](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide?branch=master)
*(You can change which repo branch you are viewing in this staging environment as well.)*
- [Windows UWP conceptual live site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide)

The instructions in this section apply only to UWP conceptual articles. 

> [!NOTE]
> See this <a href="/windows-authoring-guide/uwp/conceptual/images/uwp_conceptual_op_quickstartguide.pdf">Quick Start Guide</a> (PDF) for getting started quickly.

## Who can contribute?
Any Microsoft employee, vendor or intern can contribute to the documentation.

## How do I contribute? **(Internal only)**

**Contributions from within Microsoft must be made in the VSGit Repo**, either via the [Web interface](web-interface-for-small-contributions.md) for small changes or via [Cloning a local repo](setup-local-repo-for-large-changes.md) for larger changes.

The VSTS Git repo is pushed live every workday morning around 9am.

> [!NOTE]
> We provide public access to the master branch of the **windows-uwp** repo. That means that the source code of your articles--including HTML comments, commit comments, and revision history--will be visible to external developers. Articles in future release branches (ie. rs2, rs3, build2017) will eventually trickle down to the master branch after the timed release of that particular branch is published. Please plan accordingly.
