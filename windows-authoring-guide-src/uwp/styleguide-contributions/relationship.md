# Fluent Design System planning process and guidance documentation

If you are authoring or participating in the creation of [UWP Design & UI docs](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design), you are a part of Fluent Design System process.

Fluent Design System consists of mainly two phases:
1. Planning
2. Engineering/Execution

During Planning phase, we will identify the topics that need to be authored (newly or updating of existing). These topics become the next Fluent Element (i.e. features we release as part of Fluent Design System) that we developer features and release as part of SDK which is tracked by Engineering/Execution. 

For any questions about planning phase, contact [chigy](mailto:chigy@microsoft.com). For any questions about engineering phase, contact [predavid](mailto:predavid@microsoft.com).
