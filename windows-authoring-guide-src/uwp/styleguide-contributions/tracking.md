# Tracking guidance contents

Guidance contents are tracked by VSO/TFS items. By default, we track them as a documentation bug but it can be in any form (deliverable, task, etc.) as long as the item is tagged properly with **XamlDoc** and **UWP design and UI docs** tags.

Opening guidance doc bugs can be done using [this template](https://microsoft.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/OS/_workItems/create/Bug?%5BSystem.AssignedTo%5D=Chigusa+Sansen+%3Cchigy%40microsoft.com%3E&%5BSystem.Tags%5D=UWP+design+and+UI+docs%3B+XamlDoc&%5BOSG.IssueType%5D=Documentation&%5BSystem.AreaPath%5D=OS%5CCore%5CDEP%5CUXP-User+Experience+Platform%5CControls&%5BSystem.IterationPath%5D=OS%5CFuture). (This is currently set to be assigned to chigy under common control path but it should be updated to be assigned against the person who does the work in their organization's path. However by using this template as is, you can notify us of any doc issues.)

[Documentation query](https://microsoft.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/OS/_workitems?id=d9c7860f-1c08-4676-b903-0ab4414005bd&_a=query) lists all the issues we are currently tracking.

We have yet to create a query that tracks Fluent Design System Spring 2018 wave elements. Once it is created, it will be posted here.
