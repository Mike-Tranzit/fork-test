# Guide for PMs, developers, and designers contributing to [UWP Design & UI docs](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design)

All contents that are published under [UWP Design & UI docs](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design) must adhere to the Fluent Design System guidance because *[UWP Design & UI docs](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design) is the Fluent Design System guidance*. Any images, samples, explanation we provide need to be the representation of what the Fluent Design System is trying to achieve. Since Fluent Design System is organically growing, it is not expected that all authors deeply understand the Fluent Design System even though, through your writing journey, you will help us shape it together. We have a vTeam (NEONDoc) who review all the guidance that we publish to help fill this gap.

Following series of articles explain the process and steps to be followed when publishing for [UWP Design & UI docs](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design).

- [Fluent Design System planning process and guidance documentation](relationship.md)
- [Tracking work](tracking.md)
- [You were assigned a guidance doc bug, now what?](authoring.md)
