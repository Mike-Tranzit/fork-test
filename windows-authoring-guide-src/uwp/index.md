This section provides instructions for writing UWP app documentation.

## What is UWP?
UWP stands for Universal Windows Platform. Since their debut in Windows 8, UWP apps have had many different names, including "Universal apps", "Windows Runtime apps", "Windows Store apps", "Windows Phone Store apps", "Universal Windows apps." The current agreed-upon term is "UWP apps."

## UWP article types
There are two types of UWP articles:
* Conceptual articles: Also known as "How-to" articles, each article describes a specific feature or task. [Authoring instructions for conceptual articles](conceptual/index.md)
