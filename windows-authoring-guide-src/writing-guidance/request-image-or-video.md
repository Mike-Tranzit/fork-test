# Request a new image or video

Visual elements can convey complex topics in a simpler and more direct way than a corresponding amount of text. The visuals themselves don't have to be complex, but they do need planning and careful consideration.

Visual elements could include: 
- Conceptual graphics
- Screen captures
- Flow diagrams
- Architectural diagrams
- Posters
- Infographics
- Animated GIFs
- [One Dev Minute videos](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/One-Dev-Minute)

Quality images and videos can improve your docs:
- Make the reading experience pleasant
- Break up the "wall of words"
- Add beauty = better experience
- Reduce time to understand
- Help people figure out how something works

## Image guidelines

- Sizing for docs.microsoft.com: Recommended width for images and graphics is **720px wide**. Smaller sizes are acceptable, but make affect sharpness and readable. Larger can be okay, but anything much over 800px will be automatically shrunk by the publishing platform, and consequently "waste" the extra file size and resolution and slow down page load time.

- Format for images is preferably .PNG as it is "lossless" and will typically appear sharper than a .jpg. Images should also be optimized with a tool like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com).

- Limit the amount of text in your image: Any text within an image will not be translated for any localized content. Be sure to include any text within an image in your image alt text for accessibility so that screen readers can enable customers without sight to understand the content.

- Be sure to remove any sensitive info that could be included in screen captures.
