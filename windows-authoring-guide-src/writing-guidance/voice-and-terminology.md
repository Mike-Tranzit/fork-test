## Voice

- [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700) (formerly MSTP)

### Use a customer-friendly voice

- **Use everyday words:** Try to use natural language, the words your customers use; be less formal but not less technical; provide examples that explain new concepts.

- **Write concisely:** Don't waste words and don't over explain. Be affirmative and don't use extra words or lots of qualifiers. Keep sentences short and concise. Keep your topic focused. If a task has a qualifier, put it at the beginning of the sentence or paragraph. Also, keep the number of notes to a minimum. Use a screenshot when it can save words.

- **Easy to scan:** Put the most important things first. Use sections to chunk long procedures into more manageable groups of steps (procedures with more than 12 steps are probably too long). Use a screenshot when it adds clarity.

- **Show empathy:** Use a supportive tone in the article, and keep disclaimers to a minimum. Honestly call out areas that will be frustrating to customers. Make sure the article focuses on what matters to the customer, don't just give a technical lecture.

- **Write with SEO in mind:** Use keywords in your title (H1), description, and alt text. For more information about search engine optimization, see the Adding metadata page.

### Consider localization and machine translation

Our technical articles are translated into many other languages, and some are modified for particular markets. People might also be using machine translation on the web to read the technical articles. So, write with the following guidance in mind:

Make sure the article contains no grammar, spelling, or punctuation errors: This is something we should do in general. Markdown Pad 2.0 has a basic spell checker, but you should also paste the (rendered HTML) content from the article into Word, which has a more robust spell and grammar checker.

- **Make your sentences as short as possible:** Compound sentences or chains of clauses make translation difficult. Split up sentences if you can do it without being too redundant or sounding weird.

- **Use simple and consistent sentence construction:** Consistency is better for translation. Avoid parentheticals and asides, and have the subject as near the beginning of the sentence as possible.

- **Use consistent wording and capitalization:** Again, consistency is key. Never capitalize a word if it isn't at the start of a sentence or a proper noun.

- **Include the "small words":** Words that we consider small and unimportant in English because they are understood for context (such as "a", "the", "that", and "is") are crucial for machine translation - make sure you include them!

## Links

Always use this format: `[Display name](file-name.md)`.

**For cross references, use this syntax**:
- For more information about X, see `[Display name](link)`.
- For more information, see `[Display name](link)`.

**Do not use**:
- See `[Display name](link)` for more information about X. *(That is, don't put the "See" phrase first.)*
- For more information about X, see `[URL](link)`. *(Don't use the URL instead of the display name or target title.)*
- Click `[here](link)`. *(Don't use "here" as the display name.)*

## Acronyms and abbreviations

Always spell out on first mention and include the acronymn in parentheses. For subsequent mentions in the same topic, it's okay to use the acronym or abbreviation.

## Figures and tables

- Do not use *above* or *below* to introduce or refer to steps, tables, or figures. Use a hyperlink, or use *previous*, *preceding*, *earlier/later*, or *the following*. For example:
    - "Use the following code to display information about the database."
    - "For more information, see Installation instructions, later in this topic." (where Installation instructions is an internal link)
    - "For more information, see Installation instructions, earlier in this topic." (where Installation instructions is an internal link)
- When it makes sense, label the figure or table so that you can easily refer to it later. Place this description before the figure or table. For example:
    - "Table 1. New features in Windows 10."
    - "Figure 2. The Getting Started Wizard start page."
