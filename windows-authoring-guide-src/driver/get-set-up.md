# Get set up for contributing to Windows Driver documentation 

If you are setting up Git authoring for the first time, first follow the instructions in [Set up a GitHub account](../github-account.md). I am working to find out if this creates a fork of the master in my personal github account, BEFORE i commit. Let's find out.

The answer is that it forks the master branch (in this case, fork-test) into my personal github account and then when i click Commit, it makes a patch branch called ***.

Then, refer to [Contributing to Windows Driver Documentation](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-driver-docs/blob/staging/CONTRIBUTING.md).
